Bank System

This project is a simple bank system built in C++ that simulates common banking operations. It allows users to manage their accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, transfer funds, and more — all through an easy-to-use text-based interface.
Features:

    Create an Account: Set up a new bank account with an ID, balance, and PIN.
    Login: Securely log in using your account ID and PIN.
    Deposit & Withdraw Money: Add or take out money from your account.
    Check Balance: View the current balance of your account.
    Transfer Money: Send money to another account.
    Currency Converter: Convert money between different currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, SAR).
    Close Account: Delete your account when you're done.
    Logout: Securely log out of your account.

How to Use:

    Choose what action you’d like to perform (create an account, log in, etc.).
    Follow the prompts to complete the action (e.g., enter your account ID, PIN,       or amount of money).
    The system will guide you through the process with helpful messages.
